## Recommended Books, Tutorials & Courses

Here are some targeted resources you can tap into. I’ve categorized by (A) Books/reference, (B) Tutorials/online guides, (C) Courses. I highlight those especially useful for your background.

## A. Books / Reference Chapters

Biomedical Knowledge Mining: Methods and Protocols (via yulab-SMU “Biomedical Knowledge Mining” online book) — includes a chapter (and R code) on using clusterProfiler / enrichplot / GOSemSim for enrichment. Very hands-on. 
YuLab@SMU

Bioconductor Case Studies: Use R! (Gentleman R, Morgan M, Huber W) — Chapter “Gene Set Enrichment Analysis” covers fundamentals and tools via R. 
SpringerLink

Bioinformatics: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications (multiple editors) — broader but includes sections on enrichment/enrichment tools. 
IGI Global

## B. Tutorials / Online Guides

Official GSEA User Guide by the Broad Institute: “GSEA User Guide”. 
GSEA MSigDB

Blog/tutorial: “A Short Guide to Enrichment Analysis” by Ivo Kwee (BigOmics) — easy to read, covers ORA vs GSEA, gene sets, stats. 
BigOmics Analytics 
Bigomics. (2024). [A Short Guide to Gene Set and Pathway Enrichment Analysis](https://bigomics.ch/blog/a-short-guide-to-gene-set-and-pathway-enrichment-analysis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

R notebook tutoria
l: “Gene Set Enrichment Analysis with clusterProfiler” (GenCORE facility) — good for hands-on R. 
Gencore

R tutorial: “Easy GSEA in R with fgsea()” — step-by-step with code. 
Biostat Squid

Galaxy Training: “RNA-seq genes to pathways” — for a workflow in Galaxy. 
Galaxy Training Network

Video tutorial: “How to perform GSEA – a tutorial on RNA-seq” on YouTube.

## C. Courses

While not purely dedicated to enrichment analysis, the book The Biostar Handbook (and associated online course) includes sections on RNA-seq and downstream pathway analysis.
